## Stake Pool Hardware

RV64 is the first RISC-V ISA powered cardano stake pool.

RISC-V (pronounced "risk-five") is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on established reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. The RISC-V ISA is provided under open source licenses that do not require fees to use.

RV64 consist of 4 SiFive Unmatched computers running Ubuntu Linux, the servers have a quad core SiFive Freedom U740 SoC superscalar RISC-V CPU @1.4GHz, 16GB RAM and 500GB SSD. All servers have two Gigabit network interfaces. The pool is connected to the internet using 1Gbps up and downstream primary connection and a fallback connection over 4G/LTE. RaspberryPIs is used for console, metrics and alerting. The 1000VA UPS can run the complete stakepool for about 1 hour and 30 minutes as it just uses 100W.
