## About Us

Firstly, it is a pleasure to be in the front line to create a real decentralised Cardano network!

We believe passionately that a better world is possible, and the answer to our environmental issues find on people. Using Cardano's decentralized financial system, we may obtain funding to support environmental organizations in their fight. With your support, we hope to participate in the battle to save and help reverse the steep decline in the overall ecological health of our planet.

## Values

- High level of ethics and integrity.
- Be rigorous in the information to spread.
- Transparency in our actions and donations. Show the way how we support environmental organizations.
- Freedom of expression of thought and creation of ideas.
- Be responsible with society and the environment.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to spread environmental organizations' work to safeguard our ecosystems, wilderness, and flora and fauna now and for future generations by creating a media platform using YouTube, blogs, Instagram, Twitter, etc.

## Stake Pool Hardware

We use three relays and 2 of them are based on Raspberry 4 using 2 USB 250Gb crucial SSD. We have used the resources of Armada Alliance to set up our nodes. We are familiar with Raspberries because we have worked before many times in different projects, but never using it as cryptocurrencies nodes.
