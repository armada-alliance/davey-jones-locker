## About RUBY

RUBY is an independent and mission-driven Cardano Stake Pool dedicated to participating in the decentralized infrastructure of Cardano in a sustainable manner, all the while working with our ADA stake delegators to earn passive staking profits. Thirty-percent (30%) of our personal fee and profits will be contributed, in the form of donations to charities, back to the community. For all the updates stay tuned with our Twitter [@rubypools](https://twitter.com/rubypools).

We started this Cardano Stake Pool with a mission of doing our part for Children across the globe. Helping Children survive and ensuring them with a fair opportunity to pursue their dreams. Supporting charities, with the same mission as ours, is our prime motivator for this pool. UNICEF and Save the Children International will be our preferred charities for our first few donations.

Proud members of [Armada Alliance](https://armada-alliance.com/) and [Cardano Mission Driven Pools](https://www.missiondrivenpools.org/).

## Our Mission

- Donate percentage of proceeds from every epoch rewards.
- Promote and support energy-efficient and decentralized blockchain operation.
- Continuous incremental investments to our server hardware and pool pledge
- Lower the entry barrier of decentralization by creating innovative tools and software.

## Stake Pool Hardware

- We are committed to operate on energy efficient hardware, therefore, we found that ARM base systems such as Raspberry Pi were perfectly suited for the task.

- While trying to keep everything minimalistic and with continuous improvement being part of our program, we are interested in exploring better ways of operating such as leveraging solar energy.

- Located in Surrey/Canada and Toronto/Canada, our relays operate on ARM devives of Raspberry Pi 4.
