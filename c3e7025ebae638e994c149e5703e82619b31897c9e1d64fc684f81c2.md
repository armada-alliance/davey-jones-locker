## Our Charity Mission

We donate 1/3 of our mining rewards to the Swiss charity organization [ATKYE](https://atkye.ch/). This organization supports scholarization for children in Kenya.
As a proof for our commitment to this charity organization, we publicly publish the bank transfer receipts on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jterrier84/minipool/tree/main/Donations). 

## Our Engagement for the Cardano Community

We provide the tools and instructions for anyone interested to run their own Cardano full node on ARM64 devices (such as Raspberry Pi or Mac Mini M1). Check out our [guide on the Armada Alliance page](https://armada-alliance.com/guides/run-a-cardano-node-with-docker) for more information.
